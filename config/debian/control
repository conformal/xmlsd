Description: Library that provides various logging services - development
 This package contains the libraries, include files, and documentation
 to develop applications with xmlsd.
 xmlsd is a library that wraps expat in order to simplify XML use in C programs
 as well as adding rigid rules to an XML structure. The idea is to have XML

 verification. This in turn enables back and forth chattering between
 applications.
