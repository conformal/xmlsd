xmlsd
=====

xmlsd is a library that wraps expat in order to simplify XML use in C
programs as well as adding rigid rules to an XML structure. The idea is
to have XML structures that can be passed over the network with implicit
parameter verification. This in turn enables back and forth chattering
between applications.
